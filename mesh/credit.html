			<h2>Facebook Credit</h2>

			<p>We generate a lot of data&mdash;we use it to make life better for our friends. We make it easier for you to connect, to communicate, and to access products and services that enrich your world.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, our unprecedented access to data can open the door to something completely new, like Facebook Credit, a major step toward connecting your Facebook profile to your financial life.</p>

			<p>Facebook Credit is simple. Every time you make an online purchase on the secure Synthesis browser, our algorithms will comb your Facebook profile to review your likes, your interactions with friends and brands, along with other engagement data to determine if you are eligible for credit. If you qualify, your reliability score will be used to calculate an interest rate that is guaranteed to be lower than American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and Discover. For larger purchases, we offer a variety of payment installment plans with either fixed or variable APR. The specific terms of your offer will be determined by your reliability score.</p>

			<img src="image" width="44%">

			<p>Our unique data sets include personality scores and brand compatibility, allowing us to identify candidates for credit offers who may not qualify with credit card companies or banks, often due to extenuating life circumstances. Even if you don't qualify for an offer right away, you can make your consumer profile more robust by continuing to shop on Synthesis, improving your odds of being approved at a later date.</p>
		
			<p>Facebook Credit is the first in our suite of Facebook Finance tools&mdash;future financial offerings will include paycheck advances, automated retirement savings management, and personal shopping services. Stay tuned to stay on top.</p>
