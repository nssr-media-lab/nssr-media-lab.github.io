			<h2>The Facebook Genome Project</h2>

			<p>Your world on Facebook should reflect your needs and desires. That's why we continue to improve our algorithms to process your data and personalize your experience. As part of a new partnership with personal genome company 23andMe, we now have the opportunity to tailor our world to fit your identity.</p>

			<p>Once you opt in to the Facebook Genome Project, you will receive a free genetic sequencing kit in the mail. In addition to the full suite of services provided by 23andMe, we will now provide you with customized features and product updates designed for your individual genetic code.</p>

			<p>News Feed is already designed to complement your mood, but with access to your genetic information, we can curate your entire experience on Facebook to complement your neurotransmitter balance and personal biochemistry.</p>

			<p>Do you have the DRD4-7R Wanderlust Gene? See photos of friends' inspiring trips abroad and get notifications about travel deals. What about variations on WSCD2 and near PCDH15 that predispose you to extroversion? Receive suggestions for new friends of up to six degrees of separation.</p>

			<p>Access to genetic information can enrich your experience, but it should also help you connect and build a better together. If you are In A Relationship, you and your partner can will be offered a compatibility report that breaks down how your genes may affect your relationship&mdash;including personality traits, physical characteristics, and reproductive risk factors. You will also be given access to social analysis products, including friend recommendation, co-living compatibility reports, and heritage affinity groups, based on data generated by the Facebook Genome Project.</p>
		
			<p>This groundbreaking collaboration is an exciting new step for the Facebook community. There's more in the works: soon, we will be able to share your genetic predispositions with healthcare providers and emergency responders, changing the course of medical treatment to save countless lives.</p>
