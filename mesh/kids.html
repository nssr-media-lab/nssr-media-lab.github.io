			<h2>Facebook Juniors</h2>

			<p>Facebook is for everyone. This is one of our most deeply held principles. We believe that a healthy, strong community is one where no one is excluded.</p>

			<p>Until now, the only restriction to having a Facebook was a requirement that users are over the age of 13. We enforced this rule to keep children safe from harm. We recognize that exclusion is never the solution, so we have consulted with early childhood development experts to remove this barrier to access.</p>

			<p>You can now sign your child up for Facebook Juniors, a secure and friendly version of Facebook for our friends who are 0-12 years of age. Facebook Juniors is an integrated part of our community, but it enforces some necessary safety guidelines. Our new young friends can join by connecting to the profile of their Senior parent or guardian, and adding new friends requires active consent from their Senior. Only approved users may interact with Juniors through posts, comments, or Messenger.</p>

			<p>For extra safety, any potentially objectionable content&mdash;such as inappropriate photos, discourse, or games&mdash;will be filtered out automatically, and can be manually unblocked at the Senior's discretion. We have trained our content moderation AI MetaEthicist to implement these safety measures and preserve the innocence of our youth.</p>

			<img src="image" width="44%">

			<p>Our research shows that social interaction at a young age conditions our youth to foster strong connections, improves consumer awareness, and impresses the value of community.</p>
		
			<p>Facebook Juniors is the right way for children to become acquainted with the Facebook ecosystem and learn responsible social interaction. By the time your child comes of age, he or she will be prepared to join the larger community and be a part of building a better together.</p>
