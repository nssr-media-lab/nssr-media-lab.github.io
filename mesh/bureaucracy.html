			<h2>Facebook for the People</h2>

			<p>Facebook was created to promote free discussion, which is the cornerstone of any democratic society. We are now expanding our mission to encourage civic engagement with Facebook for the People. This new initiative will launch with pilot projects that streamline government services in three cities across the country: Rochester, NY; Plano, TX; and Lexington, KY.</p>

			<p><strong>Rochester, New York</strong></p>

			<p>The Rochester Project focuses on the most fundamental of civic responsibilities: jury duty.</p>

			<p>The City of Rochester has contracted us to handle the summons and selection process for all jurors. All residents with a Facebook account will no longer need to communicate with Monroe County's Jury Office, and will instead be notified of their selection directly through Messenger. This streamlined process eliminates the need for tedious paperwork, as selectees may respond to their summons, request deferments, and pay fines for non-attendance with one simple, City Council-approved framework.</p>

			<p>Our data is shared with the Jury Office, which can now monitor all selectees' Facebook use to determine the legitimacy of exemption requests and resolve issues of eligibility. The efficiency of our algorithms will save Monroe County's taxpayers valuable dollars and time. It's high time we usher this age-old institution into the twenty-first century.</p>

			<p><strong>Plano, Texas</strong></p>
			
			<p>The Plano Project focuses on keeping our democratic societies active and engaged.</p>
		
			<p>We are partnering with the City of Plano to drive up participation in municipal politics by making democracy more convenient than ever. All City Council meetings will now be streamed on Facebook Live so every citizen can tune in and know what's going on in their community. Town Hall meetings will be held virtually and exclusively on Facebook, so every citizen has the opportunity to participate regardless of their schedule.</p>

			<p>Our geolocation services will allow any user currently within the city limits to participate in live video chat rooms to express their opinion on the issues at hand. We look forward to an facilitating unhindered participation in Plano's democracy to help build a healthy community.</p>

			<p><strong>Lexington, Kentucky</strong></p>

			<p>The Lexington Project focuses on streamlining the bureaucratic operations necessary to a functional society.</p>

			<p>The City of Lexington has awarded us a contract to manage the office of the DMV. All driver's license applications and renewals may now be filed electronically through Facebook. As long as your profile picture meets our new guidelines, you may now choose to use it for your license photo.</p>
		
			<p>We now have an official role in the Lexington Police Department, where all basic motor vehicle violations will be processed. You may now pay all tickets and fines through your Facebook account, and eligible Facebook Credit users can sign up for our exclusive installment plan. We are excited to break down barriers of accessibility when it comes to government fines, and our process will help you pay only the minimum amount.</p>

			<br>

			<p>These pioneering initiatives are only the beginning of what will soon be a major role for us at Facebook: serving you alongside city, state, and national governments. Our flagship team of Facebook Bureau members are already organizing their efforts to export these successes to towns and villages that still lack civic infrastructure with the goal of building healthy and engaged communities around the globe.</p>

			<p>We are grateful for the trust that these municipalities have placed in Facebook. As these pilot projects succeed, we will be working to implement them in cities across the world. We are starting on the local level, but with our eyes on the prize: by 2024, we hope you will cast your ballot in a national election on Facebook.</p>
