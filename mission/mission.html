		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>Ten years ago we debuted Facebook Connect and Open Graph, iniatives that enabled us to populate the entire web with our plugins and make Facebook the nucleus for all social activity on the web. By the end of the year, 600 million users were active on Facebook. Together we made the world more open and connected.</p>

		<p>We didn't stop there. Over the last decade, our ecosystem has thrived. Facebook is not simply a platform for relationships to flourish. It is also where information triumphs, technology conquers, business blooms, democracy reigns, and realities abound.</p>

		<p>We are now on the path to 8 billion users, streamlining Facebook as the one dimension for all social life. We are proud to share with you our core principles for the launch of a new era on Facebook.</p>

		<p><img src="mesh" style="width:80px; float:left; margin-right:20px">The Mesh is an ethereal space where the entire world can grow together. It is dynamic, sweeping us from the present and pulling us into the future. Unbounded and unlimited, it enables the integration of all social life on and off the web.</p>

		<p><img src="compass" style="width:80px; float:left; margin-right:20px">The Compass will guide as as we transcend the borders that once divided us. We invited the entire Facebook community to share in our values as we articulate the world together. Your future is our future, and we work hard to keep you safe and equipped for all aspects of social life.</p>

		<p><img src="hive" style="width:80px; float:left; margin-right:20px">Let's build the social world together. The more you share with us, the more we can share with you. We are simply here to facilitate a smooth transition into the future we all strive for. Welcome to the Hive.</p>
