			<h2>Company Standards</h2>

				<p>In 2005, Facebook had 6 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. In the third quarter of 2012, Facebook became the first social media platform in the world to reach one billion subscribers. Now, in 2020, we have over three billion users who are part of the Facebook network. The next step is to bring on six billion total members into our collective, as we prepare to shape the future.</p>

				<p>Facebook's initial mission was to "build community and bring the world closer together," and now we have brought over half of the world's overall population to share one digital space; we are on our way to effectively becoming a microcosm of the planet we live on. There are currently 7.6 billion humans on planet Earth. Almost half the population have Facebook accounts. Never has there been such a large percentage of the population all actively part of one thing at the same time, save for religion. Therefore, it is part of our responsibility as the world's leading social media collective to interconnect and elevate our herd as best we can, while allowing the mass consciousness of Facebook to grow and spread.</p>
