			<h2>Company Values</h2>
			<div class="centertext">
			<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

			<p>Making the world better starts with making the world safer. Our work behind the scenes goes beyond securing our bits. Our high-definition, bird's-eye view of every friend's activity gives us the ability and the privilege of keeping our community safe from harm. Our first priority is to protect, and then to serve.</p>

			<p><strong>Social Tech and Connection</strong></p>

			<p>Human interaction is the bedrock of society and nothing we do can't be made social. That's why we aim to bridge the divide between online and offline. We aren't here just to facilitate communication&mdash;we want to amplify it and make it operable. We are integrating with the world to make a better world.</p>

			<p><strong>Efficiency and Social Impact</strong></p>

			<p>We don't simply make products&mdash;we make tools. Our tools help conserve your time, your energy, and your attention so that you can focus on what really matters: using Facebook to change a mind, change a life, and change the world. This way we can all work together toward a common goal. Our product is society.</p>

			<p><strong>Openness and Transparency</strong></p>

			<p>Trust is the core of every healthy community. Transparency and openness are key elements to building trust. That's why we believe that every Facebook member has the right to know who we are, what we do, and why we do it. As we like to say at Menlo Park: "Be as clear as the bay waters."</p>

			<p><strong>Truth</strong></p>

			<p>The stability of a community depends on accuracy and authenticity. We are constantly monitoring all Facebook activity to ensure that our communities will remain stable. We hone our Verity tools daily to identify possible breaches and eliminate misinformation that could be harmful or deceptive. Trust us to deliver the truth.</p>

			<p><strong>Democracy</strong></p>

			<p>While Facebook was once the space for Harvard students to state opinions freely, it is now a bastion for free expression across the globe. We are committed to countering any possible encroachment of our core values and institutions. There is nowhere more convenient for communities to organize and act than on Facebook Agendas. Where democracy is hollowed out, we fill in.</p>

			<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>

			<p>Facebook has the ability to build community, give voice to the voiceless, and even topple dictatorships. Now with built-in translation in over 5000 languages, Facebook has the power to touch every person on the planet, empowering us all to mold our community. We all have the right to friendship.</p>
